# Reduxwork

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michalkow/reduxwork.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michalkow/reduxwork)

A small [Redux](http://redux.js.org) framework for creating actions and reducers that work with AJAX or WebSocket functions and create real-time apps. 

## Install

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install reduxwork
```

Or install from bower:

```bash
bower install reduxwork
```

## Usage

## Framework

I created this libary while working on my own projects. It has been really useful, so I thought others might like it as well. It was created to fit me and my own style. Did my best to turn it into an open-source project that accounts for a broad range of usecases. If you have any feedback on style, naming or other things, please let me know or submit a pull request. Thanks!
